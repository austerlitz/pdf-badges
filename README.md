# Pdf-badges
make personalized pdf files from a template and a csv file

[Demo & working prototype](https://pdf-badges.herokuapp.com/)

## Usage

Upload two files: an image or a pdf file (one-page) that should be used as a background and a csv file with the data. In the Template field modify the text template which will be rendered using the data file into each separate pdf page.

Just play around with the template and settings to see what comes out.

For syntax and settings in the template refer to prawn-pdf documentation. Use csv column names as variable names in double curly brackets ("{{}}")
